# fGrapher
fGrapher is a graphing application heavily inspired by https://www.desmos.com/calculator. It was written in rust using the egui crate for the front end and rsc for parsing inputs. I was at chapter 7 of the rust book when starting this project and this project was purley a way for me to get some hands on experience with rust. I'm sure there are much better ways to go about error handling and passing around data within the program but I have next to no experience on designing in an expandable and maintainable way. While the overall system design is lacking this project gave me a much better grasp of ownership in rust and I found myself quickly improving at small scale problems within the language.
