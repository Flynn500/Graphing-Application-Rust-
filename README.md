# fGrapher
fGrapher is a graphing application heavily inspired by https://www.desmos.com/calculator. It was written in rust using the egui crate for the front end and rsc for parsing inputs. This project was purley a way for me to get some hands on experience with rust. I was at chapter 7 of the rust book when starting this project. I'm sure there are much better ways to go about error handling and passing around data within the program.
